Powerful HTML Editing, Fully in Your Control

CKEditor 5’s advanced HTML editing capabilities give you full control over your content. With General HTML Support, you can manage custom elements, attributes, and styles, and even work with complete HTML documents—including meta tags and comments. Need to input non-standard code? Simply disable HTML filtering.

A Smarter Way to Work with Source Code

Edit HTML more efficiently with enhanced tools like syntax highlighting, code folding, and autocomplete. CKEditor 5 also automatically cleans up invalid markup, making your code easier to manage. Switch seamlessly between source view and WYSIWYG mode whenever you need to review or refine your output.

Accurate Conversion from Word and Google Docs to HTML

CKEditor 5 is built to handle complex content from Google Docs, Microsoft Word, Excel, and LibreOffice. When you paste content, the editor retains structure, formatting, and semantic meaning—headings stay headings, lists stay lists, and tables remain intact. It’s more than just copy-paste; it’s intelligent content conversion. Paste your document, switch to source code view, and get clean, usable HTML right away.

Real-Time Collaboration with Structured Editing

CKEditor 5 offers a full-featured alternative to tools like Google Docs—built specifically for teams that need both collaborative writing and clean HTML output. Collaborators can comment on specific text, images, or tables, and use track changes to suggest edits directly within the content.

Sharing is simple: open the editor, share the link, and start working together in real time. Each session is tied to a unique document ID, which stays active for an hour after the last user disconnects—so you have time to review or continue editing without losing your work. There’s no limit on the number of collaborators.

CKEditor 5 combines writing, reviewing, and discussing into a single, consistent interface—no need to switch between apps. And if some teammates prefer writing in Markdown, that’s supported too.

How to choose the perfect editor

Online HTML editor features

This section presents a whole variety of features that CKEditor has to offer

Styling and Formatting

The Basic Styles plugin provides the ability to add some basic text formatting to your document. It adds the Bold, Italic, Underline, Strikethrough, Subscript and Superscript toolbar buttons that apply these styles. If you want to quickly remove basic styles from your document, use the Remove Format button provided by the Remove Format plugin.

Copy Formatting

The optional Copy Formatting plugin provides the ability to easily copy text formatting from one place in the document and apply it to another. To copy styles, place your cursor inside the text (or select a styled document fragment) and press the button or use the Ctrl+Shift+C keyboard shortcut.

Removing Text Formatting

The Remove Format plugin provides the ability to quickly remove any text formatting that is applied through inline HTML elements and CSS styles, like basic text styles (bold, italic, etc.), font family and size, text and background colors or styles applied through the Styles drop-down. Note that it does not change text formats applied at block level..

Autoformatting

The Autoformat feature in CKEditor 5 allows you to quickly apply formatting to the content you are writing. While it can be customized, by default it can be used as an Markdown alternative. For example you bold by typing \*\*text\*\* or \_\_text\_\_ , create bulleted lists with \* or -, create headings with #, ## or ###.

Block-Level Text Formats

The Format plugin provides the ability to add block-level text formatting to your document. It introduces the Paragraph Format toolbar button that applies these text formats. The formats work on block level which means that you do not need to select any text in order to apply them and entire blocks will be affected by your choice.

Tables

This plugin adds the Table Properties dialog window with support for creating tables and setting basic table properties, such as: number of rows and columns, table width and height, cell padding and spacing, table headers setting, table border size, table alignment on the page and table caption and summary.

Inserting Images

The default Image plugin supports inserting images into the editor content. This plugin supports left and right alignment. It also allows setting image border as well as pixel-perfect alignment (by setting the horizontal and vertical whitespace). Links can be added to an image easily from the Image Properties dialog. A file manager such as CKFinder can be integrated for image upload and storage support.

Pasting Content from LibreOffice

The Paste from LibreOffice plugin allows you to paste content from LibreOffice Writer and maintain original content structure and formatting.

Pasting Content from Google Docs

The Paste from Google Docs plugin allows you to paste content from Google Docs and maintain original content structure and formatting.

Pasting Content from Microsoft Excel

The Paste from Word plugin allows you to also paste content from Microsoft Excel and maintain original content structure and formatting.

Pasting Content from Microsoft Word

The Paste from Word plugin allows you to paste content from Microsoft Word and maintain original content structure and formatting. It automatically detects Word content and transforms its structure and formatting to clean HTML.

Code Snippets
